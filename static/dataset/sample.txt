Narendra Modi is an Indian politician who has served as the Prime Minister of India since May 26, 2014. He was born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, a town in Gujarat, India. Modi is a prominent leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a right-wing political party in India, and is known for his charismatic leadership, strong oratory skills, and nationalist agenda.

Before assuming the role of Prime Minister, Modi served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, where he gained a reputation for implementing economic policies that spurred development and growth in the state. However, his tenure was also marked by controversy, particularly concerning his handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots, which resulted in significant loss of life, particularly among the Muslim community. Modi's critics have accused him of not doing enough to prevent the violence, although he has been cleared of any direct involvement by various investigations.


Narendra Modi's leadership style and policies have had a profound impact on Indian politics and society, shaping the country's trajectory in the 21st century.
