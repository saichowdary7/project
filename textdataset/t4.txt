Narendra Modi is an Indian politician who has served as the Prime Minister of India since May 26, 2014. He was born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, a town in Gujarat, India. Modi is a prominent leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a right-wing political party in India, and is known for his charismatic leadership, strong oratory skills, and nationalist agenda.

Before assuming the role of Prime Minister, Modi served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, where he gained a reputation for implementing economic policies that spurred development and growth in the state. However, his tenure was also marked by controversy, particularly concerning his handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots, which resulted in significant loss of life, particularly among the Muslim community. Modi's critics have accused him of not doing enough to prevent the violence, although he has been cleared of any direct involvement by various investigations.

As Prime Minister, Modi has pursued an ambitious agenda focused on economic development, infrastructure improvement, and social reform. He has launched several initiatives aimed at promoting financial inclusion, digital literacy, and skill development, such as the "Make in India" campaign and "Digital India" program. He has also championed initiatives like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission) to improve sanitation and cleanliness across the country.

Modi's tenure has seen both praise and criticism. Supporters credit him with taking decisive steps to modernize India's economy and infrastructure, promote entrepreneurship, and enhance India's global standing. However, critics have raised concerns about issues such as religious and social polarization, freedom of speech, and human rights violations.

In the realm of foreign policy, Modi has sought to strengthen India's relationships with various countries, including the United States, Israel, and countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. He has also played a significant role in shaping India's response to regional security challenges, particularly in relation to Pakistan and China.

Narendra Modi's leadership style and policies have had a profound impact on Indian politics and society, shaping the country's trajectory in the 21st century.
